Designing a database for an enterprise
- Create an accurate representation of data
- Relationships between the data
- Constraints on the data

Techniques:
- Entity Relationship (ER) Modelling
- Normalisation (Lossless decomposition)

After analyzing the values inserted in table BCM_ORDER_MGT, i made the assumptions written on the sql script.

ERD Relationships & Cardinality
SUPPLIERS (1) → (M) ORDERS

One-to-Many (1:M): A supplier can have multiple orders, but each order belongs to only one supplier.
ORDERS (1) → (M) ORDER_LINE

One-to-Many (1:M): Each order consists of multiple order lines, but an order line belongs to only one order.
ORDER_LINE (M) → (M) INVOICE

Many-to-Many (M:M): An order line can be associated with multiple invoices (partial payments possible), and an invoice can be associated with multiple order lines.
INVOICE (1) → (M) INVOICE_ORDERS

One-to-Many (1:M): One invoice can have multiple order lines mapped via the INVOICE_ORDERS table.

DBMS used:
